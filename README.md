## What is IndianWhisper?

IndianWhisper is a free, on-device voice-to-text app for Mac. It uses OpenAI's Whisper AI models (via WhisperKit) to transcribe your speech and auto-type it wherever your cursor is — VS Code, Slack, Chrome, Terminal, anywhere.

Your voice data **never leaves your computer**. No cloud. No API calls. No tracking.
