This post is the exact list of what is saved, where it lives, who can read it, and how to remove it.

[IMAGE: Hero — deep-dark BG + neon cyan illustration of three devices (Mac, Windows laptop, Chrome browser) syncing to a cloud labeled "Mumbai." Brand palette only.]

## Why we built cloud sync

The most-requested feature since the Mac app shipped was: "If I dictate something on my MacBook in the morning, why can't I see it on my Windows laptop in the evening?"

The honest answer used to be: every transcript lived only on the device that produced it. Local-first was a privacy choice, but also a sync ceiling. Three apps, three separate libraries.

v2.3.0 lifts that ceiling. Sign in once, and the same transcript library is visible from the Mac app, the Windows app, and the Chrome extension. Search a thing on any device — find it on every device. That is the killer feature, and it does not work without cloud storage.

So we added cloud storage. And we are explaining it on day one.

## Who actually triggers a cloud save

Only signed-in users.

If you do not sign in, the app behaves the same as v1: transcripts live on your device, audio never leaves your machine, our servers know nothing about you. Same promise as the day we shipped.

If you do sign in — for cross-device sync, billing, or future team features — new transcriptions push to the cloud library. Old transcripts that lived locally before v2.3.0 are not retroactively uploaded. Only what you create after sign-in.

There is no separate "send my data to the cloud" toggle. Signing in is the toggle.

## What gets stored — column by column

Here is the actual \`transcripts\` table schema in our Supabase project. Every row is one dictation:

- **\`raw_text\`** — the original Whisper output, full transcript, no truncation
- **\`cleaned_text\`** — the LLM-polished version (only if you enabled cleanup)
- **\`language\`** — BCP-47 detected language code (\`hi-IN\`, \`en-IN\`, \`hi-Latn-IN\`, \`gu-IN\`, etc.)
- **\`model_used\`** — which engine produced the text (\`whisper-tiny\`, \`gemini-2.5-flash\`, etc.)
- **\`llm_cleanup_model\`** — which LLM you ran cleanup through, or \`null\`
- **\`duration_seconds\`**, **\`word_count\`**, **\`char_count\`** — basic metadata
- **\`source\`** — which app captured it (\`mac\`, \`chrome\`, \`windows\`, \`studio-upload\`, \`studio-live\`)
- **\`kind\`** — type of capture (\`dictation\`, \`meeting\`, \`note\`, \`upload\`)
- **\`app_context\`** — which app you were dictating into, e.g. \`{"app": "Xcode"}\` on Mac, \`{"host": "gmail.com"}\` in Chrome. Optional and easy to scrub.
- **\`audio_sha256\`** — a one-way hash of the audio, used so re-syncing the same recording does not create duplicates
- **\`voice_commands\`** — voice editing commands used in the session, e.g. \`["scratch_that", "delete_word"]\`
- **\`created_at\`**, **\`updated_at\`** — timestamps

**What is not stored:** the audio file itself. We never see the recording, never save it, never upload it. The \`audio_sha256\` field is a 256-bit fingerprint computed on your device — it lets us detect duplicates without seeing the bytes.

If a column above ever changes — added, renamed, or removed — the migration ships in our open repo before going live in production. Schema is the contract.

## Where the data lives

Supabase, region \`ap-south-1\`. That is the Mumbai data center.

Two reasons. First, latency — typically under 100ms for Indian users, fast enough for search results to feel instant. Second, data residency under the DPDP Act 2023. Personal data of Indian users stays in Indian infrastructure by default. Nothing routes through US data centers for storage or query.

If you are based outside India, your transcripts still live in Mumbai for now. A multi-region option may ship later if demand justifies the operational complexity, but India-first stays the default.

## Who can read your transcripts

Only you.

The database has row-level security on every user-content table. Every query, without exception, is scoped to your user ID by the JWT in your Supabase session. There is no admin escape hatch in the application layer.

Right now, I am the only person with database-admin access, and I have not read a user transcript. When the team grows, access will be logged, auditable, and require a stated reason — and the policy will be public before any new person gets keys.

For sensitive workflows — legal, medical, anything under NDA — the safest move stays the same as v1: do not sign in. Local-only mode is still the default for unauthenticated use, and nothing leaves the device.

## How to delete your data

Email **support@indianwhisper.com** with the subject "Delete my data." We soft-delete on request and hard-delete the row within 7 days. Hard-delete means the row is gone — not flagged, not anonymized, gone. Soft-deleted rows also auto-purge after 30 days even without an explicit request — the row is gone either way.

A user-facing "Delete my data" button in Settings is the next ship. Until then, email is the path.

Per-row delete from inside the app is on the roadmap; for now, full-account delete via the email above is the path.

## Why this post exists before the privacy policy update

The privacy policy is being rewritten this week to reflect cloud sync. We could have shipped it quietly and let people stumble on it.

We chose not to. The right move when you change what data you collect is to write a plain-English note to the people who trusted you with the previous version. That is this post.

If anything here surprises you or feels incomplete, reply on LinkedIn or email support directly. Corrections in the next 48 hours go straight into the policy before it ships.

## What is coming next

The schema includes a \`transcript_chunks\` table with \`pgvector\` embeddings — semantic search across your full library. You will be able to ask "find the transcript where I talked about the Nginx config" and get the right paragraph, not just a keyword match. On the roadmap; shipping in a future release.

After that: team workspaces (the \`org_id\` column is already in the schema, nullable, waiting), and native mobile to round out the surface area.

## Try it

Update to v2.3.0 at [indianwhisper.com/download](https://indianwhisper.com/download). Sign in once on any device, then on the others. Same library, everywhere.

If you have questions about anything in this post — what we store, where, why, or how to remove it — reply on LinkedIn or email **support@indianwhisper.com**. The whole point of this post is that the questions are welcome.`,

    content: `[MacWhisper Pro](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper) is €59 lifetime on Gumroad, or $6.99/month on the App Store. IndianWhisper is free. Forever. No subscription, no file caps.

If the comparison stopped at price, this would be a 200-word post. Both apps run OpenAI's Whisper models on your Mac. The real differences sit underneath: which accents the model handles, how far past your Mac the tool reaches, and which bytes ever leave your laptop.

I built IndianWhisper. This is the comparison I wish I had read before paying for a lifetime tier last year.

## Where MacWhisper genuinely wins

A comparison post that is not fair is just an ad. There are jobs MacWhisper does better today.

**File-based transcription.** Drop a folder of recordings on MacWhisper. It chews through them with batch processing, timestamped output, and SRT/VTT export. IndianWhisper does live dictation, not file batch. If you process recorded interviews or podcasts, MacWhisper Pro is the better tool for that job.

**YouTube URL ingest.** Paste a link, get a transcript. We do not have this.

**Speaker diarization.** Two-speaker conversations come out labelled in MacWhisper Pro. We do not diarize today. For doctor-patient consultations or two-host podcasts, that is a real edge.

**Maturity.** MacWhisper has shipped since 2022. The polish on file-import, the model picker, and the export menu reflects three years of iteration. IndianWhisper is one year old.

If your work is "transcribe these 20 hours of recordings," MacWhisper Pro is the right answer. The €59 one-time is fair pricing for that workflow.

The rest of this post is about every other workflow.

## Where IndianWhisper wins

**Indian accents and Hindi / Hinglish, first-class.** This is why the project exists. Whisper Large handles Indian English well; both apps benefit. IndianWhisper layers a punctuation + voice-command pass tuned on Hinglish code-switching. Say a sentence Hindi-English-Hindi mid-stride and IndianWhisper outputs clean text — Devanagari where you want it, English where you want it. MacWhisper produces Whisper's raw output, sometimes transliterated, sometimes oddly capitalised.

**Free, with no asterisk.** MacWhisper free runs only the small Whisper models (Tiny + Base) and is missing batch processing, speaker diarization, and SRT/VTT export. IndianWhisper free is unlimited dictation, [all five Whisper models](https://indianwhisper.com/blog/whisper-ai-models-explained-which-one-to-use) (Tiny 75 MB → Large 3 GB), the full cleanup layer, and the Chrome extension. No paywalled Pro mode. Payment infrastructure exists but is turned off until there is a paid feature worth charging for.

**Chrome extension reach.** MacWhisper is a Mac app. It dictates into the focused window via system input. The IndianWhisper Chrome extension is a different surface — a floating mic button that drops cleaned text into Gmail compose, Slack web, Google Docs, LinkedIn DMs, ChatGPT, and Notion, on any laptop where Chrome runs. If half your day is in web apps, the extension is the difference between "I dictate sometimes" and "I dictate everything."

**Optional LLM cleanup with your own keys.** A finished Whisper transcript still has filler words and half-formed sentences. IndianWhisper's optional cleanup routes the text (not the audio) through one of seven LLMs you choose — Groq, Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Moonshot, DeepSeek, or OpenRouter — using a key you bring. MacWhisper has no comparable feature today.

**Voice editing commands.** "Scratch that" deletes the last sentence. "Delete word" deletes the previous word. "Clear all" wipes the buffer. Spoken inline while you dictate. MacWhisper relies on macOS dictation defaults, which are weaker.

## The privacy question (this is where most readers actually live)

Both apps load Whisper models locally and transcribe on your Mac's CPU/GPU. For audio, that is not marketing — it is what the code does. Apple Silicon runs Whisper Large at usable speed; Intel Macs are slower but still local.

What changes between the two apps is the optional layer above transcription.

**MacWhisper Pro (Gumroad, €59 lifetime):** Audio stays on your machine. Transcripts stay on your machine. There is no first-party cloud step. (The App Store version has its own caveats — review the listing if you go that route.)

**IndianWhisper (free):** Audio stays on your machine for Whisper transcription. If you turn on optional LLM cleanup, the *finished text transcript* (not audio) goes to whichever LLM provider's key you supplied. If you leave LLM cleanup off — the default — nothing leaves your laptop.

What this means in practice:

- **Doctors and lawyers handling protected content:** Leave LLM cleanup off. Audio and text stay on the Mac. Both apps clear this bar; pair with FileVault for hardware-disk encryption.
- **Journalists handling source recordings:** Both apps run the same way for audio. If you use cleanup, point it at a self-hosted LLM via OpenRouter or skip the layer.
- **Compliance reviews:** The bytes that leave the machine are auditable. If your review board wants "no third-party processors," turn off cleanup. If they accept named processors with DPAs, pick one of the seven and bring your own enterprise key.

A deeper write-up on what "on-device" actually means at the network layer is in our [on-device vs cloud privacy](https://indianwhisper.com/blog/on-device-vs-cloud-voice-recognition-privacy) post.

## The feature matrix

| Feature | MacWhisper Pro (Gumroad €59 lifetime) | IndianWhisper (free) |
|---|---|---|
| Price | €59 one-time (≈ $69 USD) | **₹0 / $0 — no subscription, no caps** |
| Free tier | Tiny + Base models only, no batch / no diarization / no SRT export | **Unlimited dictation, all 5 Whisper models** |
| On-device audio | Yes | **Yes** |
| Optional cloud LLM cleanup | No (text stays local) | **Yes — 7 providers, your key, off by default** |
| Indian English / Hindi tuning | Whisper default | **Tuned punctuation + Hinglish handling** |
| Chrome extension (Gmail / Slack / Docs / ChatGPT / Notion) | No | **Yes — live** |
| Real-time dictation | Yes | **Yes** |
| File / folder batch transcription | **Yes — strong** | Not yet |
| Speaker diarization | **Yes (Pro)** | Not yet |
| YouTube URL transcription | **Yes (Pro)** | Not yet |
| Voice editing commands (scratch that, delete word) | macOS dictation defaults | **Yes — built-in** |
| System-wide hotkey | Yes | **Yes — Cmd+D, configurable** |
| Whisper models bundled | Multiple (largest in Pro) | **All 5 (Tiny 75 MB → Large 3 GB)** |
| Last shipping update | Active | **Active — auto-update every 6 hours** |

A quick note: this is "MacWhisper Pro on Gumroad" vs. "IndianWhisper free." The Gumroad lifetime is the version most reviewers benchmark. The Mac App Store SKU is structured differently and is priced as a subscription — I would compare against that separately if you are considering it.

## A 10-minute dictation session, both apps

I ran the same 10-minute block on each app, same M5 Mac, Whisper Large on both sides:

**Email reply in Gmail (web).** MacWhisper triggers macOS dictation in Chrome's text field — works, but no inline editing. IndianWhisper's extension floats a mic over the field; smart punctuation, "Scratch that" rewinds the last sentence by voice.

**Slack message to a colleague (web Slack).** MacWhisper relies on system dictation — punctuation is a coin flip. IndianWhisper's extension drops cleaned text with the question mark and comma in the right places.

**Google Doc with a paragraph mixing English and Hindi.** MacWhisper handles the English; the Hindi comes through transliterated (Latin script of Devanagari) — usable but not what was wanted. IndianWhisper's Hinglish pass keeps the Hindi sentence in clean Devanagari and the English sentence in English, correctly separated.

**A 14-minute audio file of a recorded interview, into MacWhisper's batch import.** Drag, drop, transcript with timestamps and speaker labels, export to SRT. Smooth. IndianWhisper does not handle file batch today. Score one for MacWhisper.

If your week is 80% live web-app dictation and 20% file batch, IndianWhisper is the daily driver and you keep MacWhisper around for the file work. If the mix is inverted, flip the order. (More on the [voice-vs-keyboard speed math](https://indianwhisper.com/blog/voice-typing-vs-keyboard-typing-speed-comparison) in another post.)

## FAQ

**Is IndianWhisper as accurate as MacWhisper?**
For audio, yes — same Whisper models, same on-device runtime. IndianWhisper pulls ahead on Indian English, Hindi, and Hinglish because of the layers above Whisper. For pure American English on a clean mic, the apps are functionally tied.

**Why is IndianWhisper free?**
The Mac app is the front door. We will eventually charge for higher-volume or team features — the payment plumbing exists, turned off. Users first, revenue later.

**Does either app send my audio to the cloud?**
For Whisper transcription: no, both run locally. MacWhisper Pro on Gumroad has no first-party cloud step. IndianWhisper's optional LLM cleanup sends the *finished text* (not audio) to whichever provider key you supplied, only if you turn it on. Default off.

**Which is better for legal or medical work?**
Both clear the audio-stays-local bar. Pick MacWhisper Pro if you need diarization and file-batch workflows for depositions. Pick IndianWhisper if you dictate live notes into web apps and want the cleanup layer kept off.

**Can I run both?**
Yes. Different hotkeys, different surfaces, no conflict. Most heavy users we have talked to keep both — IndianWhisper for daily web-app dictation, MacWhisper for batch transcription.

**Chrome extension on Windows or Linux?**
The extension runs wherever Chrome runs. The Mac app is macOS 14+. Windows and Linux native apps are on the roadmap, not shipped today.

## The single move worth making this week

If you are about to pay €59 for MacWhisper Pro and your work is mostly live dictation in browsers and Hindi-English mix typing, install IndianWhisper free first. Run it for a week. If file batch + speaker diarization end up being the missing piece, then buy MacWhisper Pro and keep both. You are out nothing and you have ground truth.

    title: "Voice Typing vs Keyboard: The Speed Gap Nobody Talks About",
    description: "The average person types 40 WPM but speaks at 150 WPM. That's 800+ hours wasted per year. Here's the data behind why voice is 3.75x faster.",

    tags: ["productivity", "voice-typing", "data"],
    content: `## You're Wasting 800 Hours a Year Typing

Let's do the math.

The average professional types **40 words per minute**. That's the global average according to typing speed studies — and most people overestimate their own speed.

The average person speaks at **150 words per minute** in normal conversation. Not rushing. Not dictating. Just talking naturally.

That's a **3.75x speed difference**.

### What Does 3.75x Actually Mean?

If you spend 3 hours a day typing (emails, Slack, docs, code comments), here's what you're losing:

| Metric | Typing (40 WPM) | Speaking (150 WPM) | Time Saved |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| Per day | 3 hours | 48 minutes | **2.2 hours** |
| Per week | 15 hours | 4 hours | **11 hours** |
| Per month | 65 hours | 17 hours | **48 hours** |
| Per year | 780 hours | 208 hours | **572 hours** |

That's **572 hours per year**. At $25/hour, that's **$14,300 in lost productivity**.

### Why Don't More People Use Voice Typing?

Three reasons:

**1. Accuracy was terrible.** Until 2023, voice recognition made too many mistakes. You'd spend more time correcting errors than you saved. OpenAI's Whisper changed everything — it understands context, handles accents, and gets punctuation right.

**2. Privacy concerns.** Most voice tools send your audio to the cloud. Every word you speak goes to someone else's server. For developers working on proprietary code, that's a dealbreaker.

**3. It felt weird.** Speaking to your computer in an open office? Awkward. But remote work changed this. You're already on calls all day — why not talk to your editor too?

### The New Generation of Voice Tools

Modern voice-to-text tools like IndianWhisper solve all three problems:

- **Accuracy**: Whisper AI models achieve 95%+ accuracy on English, even with Indian accents
- **Privacy**: Audio stays on-device. Sign in for transcript sync; opt out by not signing in.
- **Natural**: Smart punctuation means you say "comma" and it types ",". Say "new line" and it moves down. No editing needed.

### The Real Advantage: Thinking Speed

Here's what nobody mentions — **voice typing matches your thinking speed**.

When you type, there's a bottleneck between your brain and the keyboard. Your thoughts are faster than your fingers. This creates a cognitive queue — ideas pile up waiting to be typed, and some get lost.

When you speak, the bottleneck disappears. Your mouth can keep up with your brain. Ideas flow directly into text. No queue. No lost thoughts.

This is why writers who switch to voice dictation report not just faster output, but **better quality** — they capture nuances they would have simplified for the keyboard.

### Try It Yourself

[IndianWhisper](https://indianwhisper.com) is free, runs entirely on your Mac, and takes 60 seconds to set up. Or try the [live demo](https://indianwhisper.com/#try-it) in your browser right now — no install needed.

The 3.75x speed gap is real. The question is whether you'll keep wasting 800 hours a year, or start speaking.`,

    content: `## Voice Is Eating the Keyboard

In 2024, OpenAI released Whisper and voice recognition accuracy crossed the 95% threshold for the first time. In 2025, on-device models made it private. In 2026, we're seeing the first generation of tools that make voice the *default* input method.

Here are 7 predictions for where voice AI is heading:

### 1. Voice-First IDEs Will Emerge

Developers already use Copilot to write code with text prompts. The next step is obvious — **speak your intent, get code**.

"Create a function that takes a list of users and returns only those who signed up in the last 30 days."

That's not a prompt you'd type. That's a sentence you'd say. Voice-first coding tools will understand context from your codebase and generate code from natural speech.

IndianWhisper already does the transcription part — it types code at your cursor in VS Code. The next generation will add code intelligence to the voice pipeline.

### 2. On-Device Models Will Dominate

Cloud-based voice AI has a fundamental problem: **latency + privacy**.

Every word you speak goes to a server, gets processed, and comes back. That's 200-500ms of delay — enough to break your flow.

On-device models like WhisperKit run in under 50ms on Apple Silicon. That's **real-time**. No internet needed. No data sent anywhere.

By end of 2026, we predict 80% of consumer voice tools will run on-device. The cloud will be reserved for enterprise features and fine-tuning.

### 3. Voice Commands Will Replace Keyboard Shortcuts

Instead of memorizing Cmd+Shift+P → "Format Document" → Enter, you'll say:

"Format this file."

Voice commands are already appearing in tools like IndianWhisper ("scratch that" to undo, "new line" to move down). This will expand to:

- "Bold this paragraph"
- "Move this function above the class"
- "Run the tests"
- "Deploy to staging"

The mouse and keyboard won't disappear — but they'll become secondary inputs for precision tasks.

### 4. Multilingual Voice Will Break Language Barriers

Current voice tools work best in English. But Whisper supports 99 languages, and the models are getting better every quarter.

By 2027, a developer in Bangalore will be able to speak in Hindi and get clean English code comments. A PM in Tokyo will dictate in Japanese and get English Slack messages.

IndianWhisper already supports Hindi/Hinglish → English transcription. This is just the beginning.

### 5. Voice AI Agents Will Listen, Not Just Transcribe

Today's voice tools convert speech to text. Tomorrow's will **understand and act**.

Imagine a voice AI that:
- Listens to your standup meeting and creates Jira tickets
- Hears you describe a bug and finds the relevant code
- Takes your verbal design feedback and updates the Figma file

The transcription layer (Whisper) is solved. The action layer (agents) is next.

### 6. Privacy Will Become a Selling Point

As voice AI becomes ubiquitous, the privacy question will get louder:

"Every word I speak goes to Google/Apple/OpenAI?"

On-device tools that guarantee zero cloud processing will command a premium — or in IndianWhisper's case, earn loyalty by being free AND private.

The apps that win will be the ones that can say: **"Your audio never leaves your machine."** Not as marketing, but as an architectural guarantee.

### 7. Voice Will Be the Default Mobile Input by 2028

Typing on a phone keyboard is the worst input method ever invented. Small keys, autocorrect chaos, slow speeds.

Voice is the natural replacement. WhatsApp already shows voice messages are preferred in many cultures. The next step is voice-to-text that's good enough to replace the keyboard entirely.

### The Bottom Line

We're at an inflection point. Voice AI has crossed the accuracy, speed, and privacy thresholds that held it back for decades. The tools exist today — [IndianWhisper](https://indianwhisper.com) is one of them.

The question isn't whether voice will replace typing. It's when. And the people who switch early will have a 3.75x productivity advantage over everyone else.`,

    content: `## Where Does Your Voice Go?

Every time you use a voice assistant, your audio is being processed somewhere. The question is: **where?**

### Cloud Voice Recognition

When you use Siri, Google Assistant, or most voice-to-text tools, here's what happens:

1. Your microphone captures audio
2. Audio is **sent to a remote server** over the internet
3. The server processes it using large AI models
4. Text is sent back to your device

This means:
- **Your voice data is on someone else's server** — even if temporarily
- **An internet connection is required** — no WiFi, no transcription
- **Latency is added** — 200-500ms round trip
- **Your data could be stored** — for "improvement" or training

Google's privacy policy states they may retain voice data for up to 18 months. Apple says Siri recordings are stored for 6 months. Amazon's Alexa recordings are kept indefinitely unless you manually delete them.

### On-Device Voice Recognition

When you use an on-device tool like IndianWhisper, the flow is different:

1. Your microphone captures audio
2. Audio is processed **locally on your CPU/GPU**
3. Text appears instantly
4. **Nothing is sent anywhere. Ever.**

No server. No internet. No data retention. The audio exists only in your computer's RAM and is discarded after processing.

### Why This Matters for Developers

If you're a developer, you're speaking about:
- Proprietary code and architecture
- Client names and project details
- Internal tools and infrastructure
- Security vulnerabilities you're fixing
- Business logic and trade secrets

Sending all of that to a cloud server — even encrypted — is a risk. One data breach, one rogue employee, one government subpoena, and your spoken words are exposed.

### The Technical Difference

**Cloud models** like Google's USM or OpenAI's cloud Whisper API use massive server-side GPUs. They're powerful but require network access.

**On-device models** like WhisperKit (used by IndianWhisper) are optimized versions of OpenAI's Whisper, compiled for Apple's Neural Engine and Metal GPU. They run in real-time on an M1 chip using about 800MB of RAM.

The accuracy difference? Negligible for English. The Base model (140MB) handles daily use perfectly. The Large V3 model (3GB) matches cloud accuracy.

### Speed Comparison

| Metric | Cloud (Google/OpenAI) | On-Device (WhisperKit) |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Latency | 200-500ms | <50ms |
| Requires internet | Yes | No |
| Works on airplane | No | Yes |
| Data sent to server | Yes | Never |
| Processing speed | 1-2x real-time | 42x real-time |

On-device is faster, more reliable, and completely private.

### The Cost Difference

Cloud voice APIs charge per minute of audio:
- Google Speech-to-Text: $0.006/min
- OpenAI Whisper API: $0.006/min
- AWS Transcribe: $0.024/min
- Deepgram: $0.0043/min

At 3 hours of dictation per day, that's **$3-13 per day** or **$780-3,380 per year**.

On-device processing costs **$0**. You already own the hardware. The model downloads once (140MB for Base) and runs forever.

### Making the Switch

[IndianWhisper](https://indianwhisper.com) is built entirely on-device. No cloud fallback required. No API keys needed for basic use. Download the 2MB app, grant mic + accessibility permissions, and you're transcribing in 60 seconds.

Your voice stays on your Mac. That's not a marketing claim — it's an architectural fact. There is no server to send data to. The code is [open source](https://github.com/aiagentwithdhruv/indian-whisper) if you want to verify.

Privacy shouldn't be a premium feature. It should be the default.`,

OpenAI's Whisper is the engine behind most modern voice-to-text tools. But it comes in 5 sizes, and picking the wrong one means either slow performance or poor accuracy.

Here's the practical guide — no theory, just benchmarks.

### The 5 Models

| Model | Size | RAM Usage | Speed (M1) | English Accuracy |
|-------|------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Tiny** | 75 MB | ~400 MB | 80x real-time | ~88% |
| **Base** | 140 MB | ~500 MB | 42x real-time | ~93% |
| **Small** | 460 MB | ~1 GB | 15x real-time | ~96% |
| **Large V3 Turbo** | 1.5 GB | ~2.5 GB | 5x real-time | ~98% |
| **Large V3** | 3 GB | ~4 GB | 2x real-time | ~99% |

*Benchmarks on Apple M1 Pro via WhisperKit. Real-time means 1 second of audio processed in X seconds.*

### Which One Should You Use?

**For daily typing/dictation: Base (140 MB)**

This is the sweet spot. 93% accuracy catches virtually everything in normal speech. At 42x real-time, transcription feels instant. 500MB RAM means it runs alongside your other apps without issues.

This is what IndianWhisper recommends by default.

**For noisy environments: Small (460 MB)**

If you're in a coffee shop, coworking space, or have background noise, Small handles it better. The 3% accuracy bump comes from better noise separation and context understanding.

**For professional/medical/legal: Large V3 Turbo (1.5 GB)**

When accuracy matters more than speed — recording meeting notes, transcribing interviews, or dictating legal documents — Large V3 Turbo gives you 98% accuracy at a reasonable 5x real-time speed.

**For maximum accuracy: Large V3 (3 GB)**

Academic research, subtitling, or any use case where every word must be perfect. This is the same model OpenAI uses in their API. The downside: it uses 4GB RAM and is relatively slow.

**For quick notes/commands: Tiny (75 MB)**

Short phrases, voice commands, quick searches. If you're just saying "open terminal" or "send message", Tiny is more than enough and uses almost no resources.

### Accuracy vs Speed: The Real Tradeoff

The jump from Tiny to Base is massive — 5% accuracy improvement for just 65MB more. That's the best value upgrade.

Base to Small gives you 3% more accuracy but triples the download size. Worth it only if accuracy matters a lot for your use case.

Small to Large is diminishing returns — 2-3% accuracy for 3-7x more resources. Most people will never notice the difference in daily use.

### Indian English and Accents

Whisper was trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual audio. It handles Indian English well, especially the Base model and above. For Hindi/Hinglish mixed speech, Small or higher is recommended.

IndianWhisper adds an optional AI cleanup layer on top of Whisper — 7 LLM providers (Groq, Claude, OpenAI, Gemini) that fix any remaining transcription errors and add proper formatting.

### Try Them All

[IndianWhisper](https://indianwhisper.com) gives you all 5 models for free. Switch between them in Settings → Models. The model downloads once and works offline forever.

Start with Base. If you need more accuracy, try Small. Most people never need to go higher.`,

When people think "voice typing," they imagine dictating emails or documents. But developers are the ones who benefit most — and not in the way you'd expect.

### Where Developers Actually Type

A developer's day isn't just code. It's:

- **Commit messages** — "Fix user authentication timeout on mobile Safari"
- **PR descriptions** — explaining what changed and why
- **Code comments** — documenting complex logic
- **Slack/Teams messages** — discussing architecture decisions
- **Documentation** — README files, API docs, guides
- **Jira/Linear tickets** — describing bugs and features
- **Code reviews** — explaining what needs to change

All of this is natural language. All of it is faster spoken than typed.

### The Voice + Keyboard Workflow

The best developers don't replace their keyboard with voice — they **combine them**:

1. **Code with keyboard** — syntax, brackets, indentation still need precise input
2. **Comment with voice** — "This function handles the OAuth callback and exchanges the authorization code for an access token"
3. **Commit with voice** — "Fix race condition in WebSocket reconnection logic"
4. **Document with voice** — speak the README, let the tool type it

This hybrid approach is 2-3x faster than keyboard-only because you're using the right tool for each task.

### Real Examples

**Writing a commit message:**

Instead of typing:
\`\`\`
git commit -m "Refactor authentication middleware to support JWT refresh tokens with automatic rotation and add rate limiting for failed login attempts"
\`\`\`

You press Cmd+D and say: "Refactor authentication middleware to support JWT refresh tokens with automatic rotation and add rate limiting for failed login attempts."

Same result. 3x faster. No typos.

**Explaining code in a PR review:**

Instead of typing a 5-line comment, you speak:

"This approach won't scale because we're loading all users into memory. Consider using a cursor-based pagination with a limit of 100 per batch. Also, the error handling on line 45 swallows the exception — we should at least log it."

That comment would take 2 minutes to type carefully. Speaking it takes 20 seconds.

**Writing documentation:**

The reason most projects have bad docs is that writing them is slow and boring. Voice changes the equation:

- Speak your API documentation while looking at the code
- Dictate the README while the architecture is fresh in your mind
- Describe the deployment process as you do it

Documentation goes from "I'll do it later" to "done in 5 minutes."

### Tools That Work for Developers

Not all voice tools are developer-friendly. You need:

- **Auto-type at cursor** — text must appear in your editor, not a separate window
- **Works in terminal** — for commit messages, CLI tools
- **Smart punctuation** — say "comma" and get "," not the word "comma"
- **Fast switching** — hotkey to start/stop, no disruption to flow
- **Privacy** — you're speaking about proprietary code

[IndianWhisper](https://indianwhisper.com) was built specifically for this workflow. Cmd+D to start, speak, text appears at your cursor in any app. Works in VS Code, Terminal, Slack, Chrome — everywhere.

### The Productivity Stack

The modern developer productivity stack in 2026:

1. **AI code generation** (Copilot/Cursor) — for writing code
2. **Voice typing** (IndianWhisper) — for everything around code
3. **AI agents** — for automation and research

Together, these tools let you build at 5-10x the speed of keyboard-only development. The keyboard isn't going away — but it's no longer the only input device that matters.

    content: `## I Paid Rs.3,800 for Something I Could Build Myself

It started with frustration.

I was building AI products — full-stack apps with FastAPI, Next.js, Supabase, LangGraph. The kind of work where you write code for 2 hours and then spend another 3 hours typing Slack messages, commit messages, documentation, PR reviews, and emails.

I think at 150 WPM. I type at 45 WPM. There is a constant bottleneck between what I want to say and what my fingers can produce.

So I bought Wispr Flow. Rs.3,800 per year. A Mac app that lets you speak and it types for you. Everywhere. In VS Code, in Slack, in Chrome. It is genuinely good.

But then I looked at my students.

### The Rs.3,800 Problem

I teach AI engineering to 500+ students. Most of them are in India. For an Indian student or early-career developer, Rs.3,800 is not nothing — that is a month of internet, or two weeks of food.

When I told my class about voice typing, the first question was always: **"Is there a free version?"**

The answer was no. Wispr is $50/month internationally. BridgeVoice — another competitor — also $50/month. Apple's built-in dictation is decent but cannot auto-type into VS Code or Terminal.

There was no good free option. So I built one.

### One Night, One App

I am not going to pretend this was a heroic 6-month engineering effort. It was not.

The building blocks already exist:
- **WhisperKit** by Argmax — runs OpenAI's Whisper model on-device on Apple Silicon
- **Swift** — Apple's native language with full macOS access
- **CGEvent** — Apple's API for simulating keyboard events (auto-type)

The hard part was not the technology. It was the polish:

- Making the menu bar app feel native
- Getting accessibility permissions to work reliably
- Adding smart punctuation ("comma" types a comma)
- Voice commands ("scratch that" to undo)
- Supporting 5 different Whisper model sizes
- Building an LLM cleanup layer with 7 providers
- Making it work in EVERY app — VS Code, Terminal, Slack, Chrome, Notes

14 Swift files. 2MB download. One night.

### Why Free?

People ask me this a lot. "You could charge Rs.500/month and make good money."

Here is my thinking:

**1. Voice input should be infrastructure, not a product.**

Typing is free. Your keyboard does not charge you per keystroke. Voice-to-text is just another input method — it should be equally free.

**2. Free tools build distribution.**

I am not trying to build a voice AI company. I am an AI engineer who builds products for clients. Every student who uses IndianWhisper knows my name. Every LinkedIn post about it reaches 10,000+ people. That is marketing I could not buy.

**3. The real money is in what comes next.**

IndianWhisper is a tool. The skills I demonstrated building it — shipping production Swift apps, Next.js websites, Chrome extensions, auto-update systems — those skills are worth Rs.3 lakh/month to the right client.

**4. Open source compounds.**

When you give something away, people contribute. They find bugs. They suggest features. They share it with their network. One free tool creates more value than a hundred paid-but-unused products.

### What I Actually Shipped

In one session, here is what got built:

**Mac App (Swift):**
- 14 source files, WhisperKit 0.9.0+
- 5 Whisper models (75MB to 3GB)
- Auto-type via CGEvent — works in any app
- Smart punctuation and voice commands
- Hindi/Hinglish support
- 7-provider LLM text cleanup
- Auto-update system with version checking
- 2MB DMG, macOS 14+

**Website (Next.js 16):**
- Premium dark UI with animated light streaks
- Live voice demo (browser, no install)
- ROI calculator showing time and money saved
- SEO-optimized blog posts
- Feedback form with voice input
- Model comparison table
- Download with Gatekeeper bypass instructions

**Chrome Extension:**
- Floating mic button on every webpage
- Works on Gmail, Slack, Docs, LinkedIn — any text field
- Smart punctuation support
- Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+S)
- Under 50KB, zero performance impact
- Submitted to Chrome Web Store

### The Response

I posted on LinkedIn: "I paid Rs. 3,800 for a voice typing app. Then I built a better one. For free."

Within 48 hours:
- People started downloading and testing
- Comments asking for Windows and Android versions
- Sales teams started using it
- Students in my bootcamp adopted it

The demand validated what I already knew: **people want voice input, they just do not want to pay $600/year for it.**

### What Is Next

The roadmap is clear:

1. **Chrome Extension** — submitted, launching this week. Works on every OS.
2. **Windows** — native app for developers on Windows
3. **Android** — APK download, no Play Store needed
4. **iOS** — PWA or App Store when it makes sense

The Mac app plus Chrome extension covers 90% of use cases. If you can open Chrome, you can use IndianWhisper. On any device. For free.

### The Lesson

**Do not compete on features. Compete on access.**

Wispr is a more polished product than IndianWhisper. They have a dedicated team, years of refinement, better error correction. I am not going to pretend otherwise.

But Wispr costs $600/year. IndianWhisper costs $0. For a student in Bangalore, for a freelancer in Lagos, for a developer in Jakarta — that difference is everything.

The best product is not always the most polished. Sometimes it is the one that is available.
