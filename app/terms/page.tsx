              IndianWhisper is a voice-to-text product available as:

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">

              We offer a free tier and a paid Pro tier. The full feature breakdown lives on the{" "}

            <p className="mb-3">
              The free tier doesn&apos;t require an account. You can install and use it without giving us
              an email.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Pro tier and cloud sync require sign-in via email one-time-password (no password
              for you to remember or for us to leak). You&apos;re responsible for keeping access to that
              email secure. One Pro Lifetime license activates up to 3 machines; one Pro Monthly /
              Annual subscription activates 1 machine at a time and you can switch machines from the
              account dashboard.

              <li>Lemon Squeezy is the seller of record on your invoice / card statement.</li>

              After 30 days, refunds are case-by-case. Subscription renewals can be cancelled at any
              time; cancelling stops the next charge but doesn&apos;t refund the current period (the
              service stays active until the end of the period you paid for).

              We grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use IndianWhisper
              on your devices. Pro Lifetime means &quot;the life of the product,&quot; which we commit to
              meaning <strong className="text-white">at least 5 years of major-version updates from
              your purchase date.</strong> If we ever shut the product down, signed-in users get 60
              days&apos; notice and a tool to export every transcript before shutdown.

              <li>Run automated bulk transcription that abuses the free tier&apos;s daily limits, or share Pro keys with people outside your household / company.</li>
              <li>Use IndianWhisper to transcribe content you don&apos;t have the legal right to record (e.g. recording calls without consent in jurisdictions that require it).</li>
              <li>Attempt to circumvent license checks, modify the app to bypass tier limits, or distribute patched builds.</li>

              You can stop using IndianWhisper any time, and you can request account deletion at any
              time per the{" "}

              fraudulent chargebacks, or that we have reasonable grounds to believe are committing
              fraud. Where it&apos;s safe to do so, we&apos;ll tell you why and give you 14 days to fix it
              before the account is closed.

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">8. No warranty</h2>
            <p>
              IndianWhisper is provided <strong className="text-white">&quot;as is&quot;</strong>. Speech
              recognition is probabilistic — every model on earth makes mistakes, especially on
              accents, code-switching, named entities, and noisy audio. We don&apos;t warrant that
              transcripts will be 100% accurate, that the service will be uninterrupted, or that the
              app will work on every future version of macOS / Windows / Chrome. You agree not to
              rely on transcripts for safety-critical, legal, or medical decisions without human
              review.

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">9. Liability cap</h2>
            <p>
              To the maximum extent permitted by law, our total aggregate liability to you for any
              claim arising out of or related to IndianWhisper is capped at <strong className="text-white">the
              total fees you have paid us in the 12 months immediately before the event giving rise
              to the claim</strong>. For free-tier users, that cap is &#8377;0 / $0. We&apos;re not liable for
              indirect, consequential, or punitive damages (lost profits, lost data, business
              interruption) — no software vendor in our price range is, and pretending otherwise
              would be dishonest.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">10. Governing law &amp; disputes</h2>
            <p className="mb-3">
              These terms are governed by the laws of <strong className="text-white">India</strong>.
              Any dispute that we can&apos;t resolve over email goes to{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">binding arbitration in Bengaluru, Karnataka</strong>,
              before a single arbitrator under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996. Language
              of arbitration: English. Each side bears its own costs unless the arbitrator decides
              otherwise. Nothing here stops either side from seeking urgent injunctive relief from a
              court.

            <p>
              If you&apos;re a consumer in the EU, UK, or any jurisdiction that grants you mandatory
              local-law rights you can&apos;t waive, those rights still apply — the arbitration clause
              doesn&apos;t override them.
